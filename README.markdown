== Installation ==

###Prerequisite###

In order to use SyntaxHighlighter Evolved Biferno, you must first install [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/).

###Installation###

Extract all files from the ZIP file, making sure to keep the file/folder structure intact, and then upload it to /wp-content/plugins/.

###Plugin Activation###

Go to the admin area of your WordPress install and click on the "Plugins" menu. Click on "Activate" for the "SyntaxHighlighter Evolved: Biferno" plugin.

###Plugin Usage###

Just wrap your code in `[sourcecode language="biferno"]`your code here `[/sourcecode]`
or
wrap your code in `[biferno]`, such as `[biferno]` code here `[/biferno]` .

The shortcodes accept a wide variety of parameters here are a few examples taken from the SyntaxHighlighter Evolved's settings page.

###Shortcode Parameters###
These are the parameters you can pass to the shortcode and what they do. For the booleans (i.e. on/off), pass **true**/**1** or **false**/**0**.

- **`lang`** or **`language`** — The language syntax to highlight with. You can alternately just use that as the tag, such as `[biferno]code[/biferno]`. Click [here](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/brushes/) for a list of valid tags (under "aliases").
- **`autolinks`** — Toggle automatic URL linking.
- **`classname`** — Add an additional CSS class to the code box.
- **`collapse`** — Toggle collapsing the code box by default, requiring a click to expand it. Good for large code posts.
- **`firstline`** — An interger specifying what number the first line should be (for the line numbering).
- **`gutter`** — Toggle the left-side line numbering.
- **`highlight`** — A comma-sperated list of line numbers to highlight. You can also specify a range. Example: 2,5-10,12
- **`htmlscript`** — Toggle highlighting any extra HTML/XML. Good for when you're mixing HTML/XML with another language, such as having Biferno script inside an HTML web page. This only works with Biferno and certain other languages.
- **`light`** — Toggle light mode which disables the gutter and toolbar all at once.
- **`padlinenumbers`** — Controls line number padding. Valid values are **false** (no padding), **true** (automatic padding), or an integer (forced padding).
- **`title`** (v3 only) — Sets some text to show up before the code. Very useful when combined with the **`collapse`** parameter.
- **`toolbar`** — Toggle the toolbar (buttons in v2, the about question mark in v3)
- **`wraplines`** (v2 only) — Toggle line wrapping.

Some example shortcodes:

- `[biferno]your code here[/biferno]`
- `[code lang="biferno"]your code here[/code]`
- `[sourcecode language="biferno" autolinks="false" classname="myclass" collapse="false" firstline="1" gutter="true" highlight="1-3,6,9" htmlscript="true" light="false" padlinenumbers="false" smarttabs="true" tabsize="4" toolbar="true" title="example-filename.bfr"]your code here[/css]`



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The code is just being displayed raw. It isn't being converted into a code box or anything. What's wrong?  =

Make sure your theme's `footer.php` file has `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` somewhere inside of it, otherwise the plugin won't be able to do it's thing.
